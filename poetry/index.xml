gently—sinking in a warm
blonde fall of sand—hourglass
drowning me ever deep—grains
on the tongue, I taste the sun
the universe—my bare skin
melts—your hands keep hold
of me—the fall—I wake up
you are gone.
Footsteps on an endless shore
fading—waves sweeping off
the memory of your walk—run
to catch your path—run—to seek
refuge in you—run—to the end
of everything—there is no end
for days—months— years, I run</description></item><item><title>Soot</title><link>http://example.org/poetry/hero-returns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 20:34:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/poetry/hero-returns/</guid><description>Trumpets beat
roses and jasmines
shower
from above
incense burns, hiding
the smell
of blood underneath
the white shroud
and trumpets drown
wails of
the son, the daughter
the mother, the father
and the widow
all the countrymen hail
the death of their
martyr.</description></item><item><title>Soot</title><link>http://example.org/poetry/soot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 20:34:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/poetry/soot/</guid><description>A small flame twinkles
it flickers as the wind blows
in the darkness—it rests
it has your name written all over
I had buried it deep
long ago, in the hope
its light would cease
to burn me
that time would turn it
into ash too
as it does to everyone
and everything
yet it is there
as new as it had been
the day I buried it
and its soot has turned</description></item></channel></rss>
