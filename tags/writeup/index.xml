      <description>You and I are so similar, broken, marred with regrets of things that happened, and longings for things that never would beâ€”we are both more words and fewer deeds, but it was never your fault; I did this to the both of us.
You are, the lava, a never-ending flow from the heart of the universe itself, creeping, burning, brighter than the brightest of suns, the sweet-child of One, One who forsook us all, and made you the lord in His stead.</description>
