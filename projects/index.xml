      <description>Introduction Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, USA. Its users are both the subscribers with annual membership and customers without any membership. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
The goal is to understand how both the types of users use the service differently to target appropriate marketing campaign and increase the number of subscribers.
Previously, data for year 2019 was worked upon, a crude analysis scratching only the surface level information.</description>
