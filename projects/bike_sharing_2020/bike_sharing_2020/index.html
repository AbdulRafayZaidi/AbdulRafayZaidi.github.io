            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, USA. Its users are both the subscribers with annual membership and customers without any who pay right when they need a bike. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.</p>
<p>The case study aims at understanding the usage patterns of both types of users. The company’s Financial analysts have determined that an Annual Subscription can be more profitable than walk-in rides. In order to increase the convert existing customers to annual subscribers, we need to figure out the hotspots, and user behaviors in order to lead successful marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Previously, data for year <a href="/projects/divvy_bike_sharing_2019/divvy_bike-sharing/">2019</a> was worked upon, a basic analysis scratching only the surface level information. In contrast, this one goes in depth, and uses geo-mapping.</p>
<p>The original data is available <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prep-work">Prep Work</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The data for year 2020 is divided into 1 quarter and 9 months. The data is downloaded, skimmed, prepared, cleaned, and manipulated. This part deals with all the dirty work prior to the actual analysis and visualization. The prep-work lays the foundation of our data problem solving, and can take twice as much time and effort as the rest of it.</p>

<h3 id="r-libraries">R Libraries</h3>
<p>A number of R libraries were called to perform different functions. Following were used to clean, prepare, and analyze the data:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="preparing-and-cleaning">Preparing and Cleaning</h3>
<p>First part of tidying is to look for problems in the data. There are a couple of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>In the data for first 11months, station ids are unique numbers. However, in the last month&rsquo;s file, the id is sometimes in accordance with the previous data, at times missing, and at others a combination of alphanumeric characters.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some Station Names and/or Station ids are missing.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In some rows complete information(both id and name) is missing about a start or end station or both.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Station Names have duplicates with an end phrase or a word.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using 11month&rsquo;s data, we create a data-frame having only Station ids and their Names. This is cleaned up by getting rid of duplicates, so we get a set of unique station ids and their respective names. We call it our <em>station_id_names</em> data frame.</p>
<p>Since the data from Jan to Nov conforms with one another, we combine it into a single data frame. Using the <em>station_id_names</em>, the missing station ids are populated by cross-referencing.</p>
<p>The data for December has problematic station ids so it&rsquo;s washed up separately. Firstly, missing station names are filled up using <em>station_id_names</em> by marching against the id columns. The id columns are then removed, and are then cross-referenced and merged by using <em>station_id_names</em>.</p>
<p>The whole dataset is then combined. Rows where both id and Name for a start or end station are missing are removed because they can&rsquo;t be referenced in any way. After tidying up, we get 3.38 million rows out of 3.52 million.</p>

<p>After the cleaning operation, our data is ready for analysis. But before that, we manipulate it to ease our analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyclistic data for year 2020 had different naming convention for its variables. To reuse some of our earlier code, and to correlate the two sets, we change some of the column names. Moreover, user types are renamed from Casual and Member to Customer and Subscriber.</li>
<li>Since we have already created <em>station_id_names</em>, we no longer need station name columns in our combined dataset because they could always be referenced by their station ids. They are removed too.</li>
<li>Longitude / latitude values for the stations are not given separately and  are included in the same row as each ride&rsquo;s information, alongside the station id and name. Since each bike has its own GPS device, there is slight variance in long/lat values of every station. However, each station can only have one unique geo-location, so we take mean value for all respective lat/long values of a station. These values are then merged in <em>station_id_names</em> data frame, and are removed from the <em>divvy_trips_2020</em>.</li>
<li>By grouping, and summarizing <em>divvy_trips_2020</em>, total number of subscribers and casual bikers visiting any station are calculated. First, we figure out total rides from starting stations, then for ending stations, and then we sum them up. The result is converted from long to wide format, number of rides by subscribers and customers falling into two separate columns, and is added to <em>station_id_names</em> data frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bike stations in this dataset can be mapped to see if there is anything out of ordinary with any station, and how the user activity might be related to the locations.</p>
<h3 id="cluster-map">Cluster Map</h3>
<p>We begin with visualizing the clusters&ndash;hotspots where most of the activity takes place.</p>
<iframe seamless src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/cluster_map.html" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>
<p><em>Most of the stations are located to the center-right, while on the periphery, the density decreases. Hovering over the stations, you can read their labels.</em></p>
<h3 id="connectivity-map">Connectivity Map</h3>
<p>From the above visualization, it is clear that some stations are more connected than the rest. People are traveling from all over the city to the stations to the center-right. While fewer people are moving between the stations on the periphery.
This is visualized as under. To reduce the clutter, only top three routes (destination points accessed from a station) are displayed.</p>
<iframe seamless src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/connectivity_map.html" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>
<p><em>You can zoom in and tap on the stations to read their details, hover over a connecting line to see the annual rides between the two stations.</em></p>
<p>In the above map, some very useful information is revealed:</p>
<p><em><strong>Some stations on the periphery are not connected to any other station</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>If we tap on those stations, we would see that their only destination is their origin, meaning that users in those neighborhood take the bike for short-travel nearby and park it back to the start point once their chores are done.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>One station inside the center-cluster is connected to only two other stations, popping out as a small pink dot</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The two stations titled <strong>HQ QR</strong> and <strong>HUBBARD ST BIKE CHECKING (LBS-WH-TEST)</strong> are probably the company&rsquo;s headquarter as the further analysis reveals only one way flow of bikes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Stations to the right, near the bank, have the most connectivity</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Station called <strong>Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave</strong> is the most connected point and lies at the bank near <em>Milton Lee Olive Park</em>. People travel to more than 450 destinations across the city from this station. Three other like this lie just near the bank, while the others in a close proximity.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The origin station is also the top destination for many stations</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you tap on some stations to open their popup window, you would see the same station name also listed as their top destination. Analyzing the data reveals that in fact most frequent routes are those that end on themselves, suggesting that users in those neighborhoods frequently use the service for short-distance movement, perhaps for their daily chores. To further establish this hypothesis, we return to our original data and analyze it further.</p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/sorted_by_customers.png" alt="Top Routes by Customers">
<em>The above table, sorted in descending order of rides taken by customers, show that the top routes are those that end at the starting station.</em></p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/sorted_by_Subscribers.png" alt="Top Routes by Subscribers"></p>
<p><em>The above table, sorted in descending order of rides taken by subscribers, also offers smilar result.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon further investigation, we see that out of <em>3.4 million</em> rides,  <em>356 thousand</em> ended at their starting station, making them <strong>10%</strong> of all the rides taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Average time for these rides is <strong>49 minutes</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-distribution-map">User Distribution Map</h3>
<p>Now that we understand overall activity at bike stations, we need to estimate the numbers of <strong>Subscribers</strong> and <strong>Customers</strong> at all stations to target appropriate marketing campaigns.
Each station gets two types of visits: one by people starting their ride, and the other by people returning a bike. Two estimate total visits, both the types need to be accounted for.</p>
<p>The size of a circle represents the magnitude of activity at that station, and its color the type of its majority users.</p>
<iframe seamless src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/leafMap.html" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>
<p><em>You can zoom in and tap on the stations to read their details.</em></p>
<p>The map shows cluster of large green circles, highly active stations dominated with subscribers, and smaller circles, the moderately active stations where majority users are casual customers, on its periphery.</p>
<p>Sniffing the above map, we find some insightful facts:</p>
<p><strong>A big green blob in the center</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the part led by subscribers, with a number of stations having more than <strong>70%</strong> of them, represented in deep green circles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two small circles in red, pop out near the central cluster</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two stations titled <strong>HQ QR</strong> and <strong>HUBBARD ST BIKE CHECKING (LBS-WH-TEST)</strong>, although surrounded with a lot of Subscriberstype stations,  have majority user type listed as Customers. These stations, as explained in our <em>Connectivity Map</em> above, are only connected amongst themselves and are likely the company&rsquo;s own facilities, causing this apparent deviation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Subscriber chunk is forming to the bottom-right</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A subscriber cluster with 12 stations is taking birth, having three deep green stations in the center, and 9 light-green stations around it. If properly targeted, this cluster could expand and unite with the big cluster in the center.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To the right of big cluster of subscribers, there are some outliers</strong></p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/Sub_cus_map_snap.png" alt="Focus Cluster on map"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The center-right region of the map is overrun with subscribers, however, some stations to the far right, close to the bank, have a majority userbase among casual riders, with some spots having more than <strong>70%</strong> of them.  Given their proximity to Subscriber hotspots, this seems like an anomaly. These stations are also very active, as apparent by their relative size. To get more information about them, we need to dig deeper into our data. For our case, we investigate <strong>Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave</strong>,  <strong>Millennium Park</strong>, and <strong>Buckingham Fountain</strong>, the three leading stations in this group, having 75%, 76%, and 80% customers respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First thing to notice is that all three of these are located on Public Parks, thereby attracting people from all over the city. So it could be the case that people come here during their weekends, and because they don&rsquo;t do so very often, they haven&rsquo;t taken any membership. To confirm this hypothesis, we analyze them by summarizing and aggregating.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Results show that average trip duration to and fro these stations is about <strong>45 minutes</strong> for both subscribers and customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our earlier hypothesis gains merit as we plot this data, calculating daily rides.</p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/tday_three_stations.png" alt="Daily rides at three stations"></p>
<p>The number of subscribers visiting these stations(in green) remains the same throughout the week, and the number is much smaller than those of casual bikers(in orange), whose activity nearly triples on weekends.</p>
<p>This can also be compared with average daily trips on all other stations.</p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/tday_all_stations.png" alt="Daily rides at all other stations"></p>
<p>As can be seen here, the result is significantly different for all other stations, where daily subscribers are far greater in number than the irregular customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For both the groups, we can also compare the time of day when the ride was taken.</p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/time_three_stations.png" alt="Daily rides at all other stations"></p>
<p>As apparent in this chart, unlike subscribers, casual bikers access these stations more during the day and evening, suggesting that they come here mostly for leisure and not for work.<br>
The hourly rides chart for these stations further establishes this point, pointing at 12pm to 5pm as the peak hours.</p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/hourly_three_stations.png" alt="Daily rides at all other stations"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same might no be true for other stations in the cluster and they would need to be studied separately. But since these three were the most active points in the cluster, the marketing team would perhaps have a better chance at getting required conversions from them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data can be further filtered to show only the top stations where most users are non-subscribers.</p>
<iframe seamless src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/customers_cluster_map.html" width="100%" height="700"></iframe>
<p><em>Top 50 stations, where most riders are casual bikers, are visualized in the above map.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The stations can be seen bundled together in small chunks.</li>
<li>Most of these lie close to the bank.</li>
<li>The clusters could be further analyzed like the previous example to understand the bikers&rsquo; patterns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above analysis has revealed very useful statistics that can help marketing team launch a successful media campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of focusing on particular stations, the company could target regions, the clusters where most casual bikers are. This could be an efficient and economical way of marketing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stations which are broadly connected, can also be helpful in spreading campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, the activity is different during different times of day and different days of week. And the behavior is not the same for both our user types. So campaigning at particular days, and times can provide better results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some routes are more frequented than the rest and need special attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correlating with above, the company could initially target the stations listed in the chart below.</p>
<p><img src="projects/Bike_Sharing_2020/most_acive_stations.png" alt="Most Active Stations"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This initial analysis provides a crude picture of  the company&rsquo;s userbase. Some of these result can be readily used for early campaigning, however, to make it successful, the analytics team must work in coordination with the marketing team, providing them base level information about specific stations or cluster whenever required.</p>
