![me](/about/me.jpg)

A **Creator, Writer, Traveler, and Engineer**.

I am fond of exploring distant lands, mountain tops, and forests, the unseen where nobody walks. It brings me close to my roots, connecting me to mother earth, the origin of all life. 

# Saving the planet

Being a professional engineer, I have become more conscious of my own environmental impacts. I am now committed to using my professional and technical knowledge in becoming part of the solution. 

So I changed that.

# Inking my heart

I have a passion for all things creative. I draw, paint, and write. I have been writing poetry and prose since an early age. Some of my creative works have won awards, including a short story titled “Giddar Singhi” that won South Asia Microfiction Award in 2020. I am also currently working on my anthology and hope to publish it soon.
