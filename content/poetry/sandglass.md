You came to me—a dream

gently—sinking in a warm

blonde fall of sand—hourglass

drowning me ever deep—grains

on the tongue, I taste the sun

the universe—my bare skin

melts—your hands keep hold

of me—the fall—I wake up

you are gone.



Footsteps on an endless shore

fading—waves sweeping off

the memory of your walk—run

to catch your path—run—to seek

refuge in you—run—to the end

of everything—there is no end

for days—months— years, I run

run—there’s no end—footsteps

on the shore ever fading—leading

me to dreams again—I can’t

dream you, again—I am falling.



The hourglass waits—flip me

over—it says—I watch: a single

grain of sand stuck inside the top

bulb, and wait for it to slide it

down.
