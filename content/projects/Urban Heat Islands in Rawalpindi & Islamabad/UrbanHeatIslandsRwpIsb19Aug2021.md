***Heat Map of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, presenting hottest and coldest regions in the twin city***

## Introduction

The goal of this study is to analyze the heat distribution under various land-use conditions in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Broadly speaking, the land-use could be classified into five types: Developed, Agriculture & Horticulture, Forest, Water, Barren. Because of limited local weather stations that monitor the air temperature, we have to rely on satellite imagery. 

Landsat 8 images dated 19th Aug, 2021 were used in this study.
