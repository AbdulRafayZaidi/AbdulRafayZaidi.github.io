# Engineer, Writer, and Climate Researcher

I am fond of exploring distant lands, mountain tops, and forests, the unseen where nobody walks. It brings me close to my roots, connecting me to the mother earth, the origin of all life. So I keep looking for ways to pay respects to the life.

But man’s greed for more has gone too far. His destructive hands have mutilated our ecosystems. The invasive industrialization, that man calls advancement, now threatens all life. Don’t get me wrong; I am down for human growth, but not how it is happening.

You go to the countryside, hoping to find a quiet reprieve, a shelter for your mind and soul, but you meet disappointment. Stumps of freshly logged trees welcome you. In place of wildflowers, you meet plastic wraps. And sometimes you come across a dead bird that has choked on human trash. 

We need to change that!

# Saving the planet

Being a professional engineer working in the manufacturing industry since 2016, I have become more conscious of my environmental impacts. My workplace mostly dealt with plastic products, so I had to find something new. A job that wasn’t a part of the problem, a place that took responsibility. So I have taken my first action, and now I am learning the tools to help protect our planet.

# Inking my heart

I have a passion for writing and have been creating poetry and prose since my school days. While I was studying engineering, a friend and I started a university magazine that published student writings. My short story titled “Giddar Singhi” won South Asia Microfiction Award in 2020. I am currently working on my anthology and hope to publish it this year.

# Capturing earth

I take photographs on my travels. My photos have been featured by various blogs, and companies. Telonor, Pakistan featured my photographs of Skardu valley in its online campaign.
